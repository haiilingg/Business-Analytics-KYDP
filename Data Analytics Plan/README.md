#  Project Aim
The company you work for is launching a new strategy game, where players must figure out different ways to complete increasingly difficult levels. The game has in-app purchases, and players can buy additional tools to help them complete the levels. The goal of the company is to grow the player base and maximise in-app purchases. Consider - how can the company leverage digital analytics?
