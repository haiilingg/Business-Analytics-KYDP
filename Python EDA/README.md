# Fast Food Marketing Campaign A\B Test
A fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. 

In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. 

A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.

### Business Goals
To increase the sales for the new menu item.

### Business Objectives
Identify the most effective marketing strategy and implement it in selected markets to drive sales growth for the new menu item.

### About the data
The dataset comprises 7 columns: 'MarketID,' 'MarketSize,' 'LocationID,' 'AgeOfStore,' 'Promotion,' 'week,' and 'SalesInThousands.' Notably, 'SalesInThousands' is the only numerical column, while the remaining 6 columns are categorical.

### Analysis Methodology
To analyze the performance of the three types of promotion strategies based on sales across all categorical columns and to examine sales by promotion type over the 4-week period.

### Important charts and insights
The sales by promotion over the 4-week period indicate that Promotion 1 generated the highest sales, while Promotion 2 generated the lowest sales. The sales remained consistent across the 4-week period for all 3 types of promotions.

Market ID 3 exhibits the highest sales with Promotion 1 contributing the most to these sales. Notably, Market ID 2 does not include any sales generated from Promotion 2.

The Large Market Size generated the highest sales, primarily attributed to Promotion 3, while the Medium Market Size generated the lowest sales among all three market sizes.

The majority of sales are generated by stores aged between 16-20, primarily attributed to Promotion 3. However, no sales are contributed by Promotion 3 for stores aged between 26-30 years.

The majority of high sales (sales amounts above the median value) are associated with Promotion 1, whereas most low sales are linked to Promotion 2.

### Conclusion
Among the 3 promotion types, Promotion 1 consistently generates the highest sales, while Promotion 2 consistently yields the lowest sales. These findings remain consistent across all analyzed categories.

### Next steps for the business to take
- The fast-food chain should adopt Promotion 1 as their future marketing strategy for promoting their new product.

- The target markets for the business to focus on should include areas with the following characteristics: Large Market Size, Market ID 3, Location ID between 200-299, and stores aged between 0-5 years as these areas demonstrated the highest sales.
